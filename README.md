## 5. Phase 2 Roadmap: Auth UI
You will guide me through building the following components inside the `/src` folder of my React app.

- [ ] **Create a `components` folder:** To keep our custom components organized.
- [ ] **Build a reusable `Input.js` component:** A styled input field for email and password.
- [ ] **Build a reusable `Button.js` component:** A styled button for submitting the form.
- [ ] **Create a `pages` folder:** To hold our main pages.
- [ ] **Build the `SignUp.js` page:** A page that uses our new Input and Button components to create a sign-up form.
- [ ] **Build the `Login.js` page:** A page that re-uses our components to create a login form.
- [ ] **Set up basic routing:** Use `react-router-dom` so we can navigate between the home, sign-up, and login pages.
