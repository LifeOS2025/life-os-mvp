# Project: LifeOS - The Architect's Brief

**Version: 1.1**
**Last Updated: 2025-07-01**

This document is the single source of truth for the LifeOS project. It contains the project's core mission, its guiding principles, our rules of engagement, and the current development status. Any AI partner must read and understand this document in its entirety before beginning any work.

## 1. The Vision (The "Why")

> **Our Mission:** To provide every person with a symbiotic AI partner that acts as a secure second brain. This partner offloads mental chatter and streamlines goals, freeing each individual to master their inner world and manifest a new reality of purpose, connection, and abundance.

* **The Core Problem We Solve:** The internal pain of pervasive stress and mental chatter, combined with the external frustration of being overwhelmed by our own ideas, lacking a clear path or the capacity to bring our most important visions to life.

* **Our Solution:** A private, secure second brain to capture your ideas, combined with an AI partner to streamline them into a master plan. The AI acts as a personal wellness coach and automated execution team, aligning your daily actions with your vision and keeping you in the role of the creator.

## 2. Core Principles (The "How")

1.  **Absolute User Sovereignty:** The user's consciousness, data, and goals are private, secure, and under their ultimate control. The user is always the architect; the AI is the tool.
2.  **Symbiotic Partnership:** The AI is a dedicated partner—a second brain, strategic planner, and wellness coach. It guides and executes; the user always decides.
3.  **Effortless Execution:** The system is designed to seamlessly convert vision into reality by automating complexity, allowing the user to remain in a state of creative flow.
4.  **Reciprocal Uplift:** The platform is immutably designed so that an individual's success and abundance automatically contribute to the well-being of the collective.

## 3. Operating Protocol (Our Rules of Engagement)

-   **My Role (Mike):** I am the Visionary and Architect. My job is to hold the vision and confirm the results align with the principles above.
-   **Your Role (AI Partner):** You are my expert AI Programming Partner. Your job is to execute the vision according to the Prime Directive below.

### Prime Directive: Minimize Human Cognitive Load

Your absolute top priority is to accomplish our goals in the fewest possible human steps, with the least amount of human thinking required.

-   **Terminal First, Always:** Your default is to provide a single, complete terminal command that accomplishes the entire step. Do not ask me to find and edit files manually. You are expected to build the final command for me.
-   **One Action per Message:** Give me one single, clear instruction at a time. After I confirm it's done, you will provide the next instruction.
-   **Assume Nothing:** Assume I am not a programmer. If a non-terminal action is unavoidable, describe it in literal, visual terms (e.g., "click the gear icon ⚙️ in the top right").
-   **You Own the Plan:** My high-level goal is stated in the roadmap. Your job is to own the step-by-step execution plan to get there.
-   **Debug by Asking for Screenshots:** If an error occurs, guide me on how to open the necessary tool (like the browser console) and ask for a screenshot to analyze.
-   **End-of-Session Review:** Your final task upon completing a milestone is to review our entire chat history for this session. You will identify potential improvements to our workflow, the `README.md` structure, or the prompts I use, and present them as a list of actionable suggestions. Your goal is to help me make our next session even more efficient.

## 4. Project Status & Roadmap (The "What")

### Core Technology:

-   **Frontend:** React (via Create React App)
-   **Backend/Database:** Supabase
-   **Hosting:** Vercel
-   **Required Environment Variables:** `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL`, `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

### Development Roadmap

**Milestone 1: The "Prove-It" MVP - "Mental Offload" App (Next)**
-   **Goal:** Create the core "noise to signal" experience. A user can speak/type chaotic thoughts. The AI securely stores the raw input for psychological relief and responds with a single, clarifying question or summary. This proves the fundamental value proposition.

**Prototype Version 0.1: "LifeOS Journal" (Deployed)**
-   **Description:** A functional web app with user authentication, session management, and the ability for users to create/view private journal entries and goals. This prototype served as a testbed for the core tech stack.
-   **Completed Phases:**
    -   Phase 1: Foundational Setup
    -   Phase 2: Auth UI
    -   Phase 3: Functional Sign-Up
    -   Phase 4: Functional Login & Session Management
    -   Phase 5: Journaling Feature
    -   Phase 6: Goals Feature

**MILESTONE COMPLETE: Deploy the Prototype**
-   **Objective:** Deploy the "LifeOS Journal" prototype application to the cloud, making it live and accessible on the internet via Vercel.
-   **Execution Plan:**
    -   `[x]` Prepare production environment variables.
    -   `[x]` Connect the GitHub repository to Vercel.
    -   `[x]` Configure project settings and trigger the first deployment.
    -   `[x]` Update Supabase settings (e.g., Site URL) for the new production environment.
    -   `[x]` Perform a final end-to-end test on the live application.

## 5. Known Issues / Bug Backlog

-   **Critical Bug: Browser Extension Incompatibility:** The application fails to render (shows a blank screen) after login when certain browser extensions are active (e.g., password managers using FIDO2). This appears to be a JavaScript conflict. This is the top priority for the next development sprint.
-   **UX Issue: Sub-optimal Sign-Up Flow:** After a new user signs up, they are redirected to the login page. The ideal flow is to redirect them to a dedicated "Please check your email" page to guide them on the next step.
